        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>We aren't just making the flavored milk tea... When I say homemade, I mean everything. From the fresh brewed milk tea all the way down to the brown sugar syrup and the homemade tapioca pearls, also known as boba pearls!</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <h3>Brown Sugar Boba Pearls:</h3>
            <li>1 cup (120g) tapioca starch</li>
            <li>1/3 cup (78ml) water</li>
            <li>1/3 cup packed (65g) brown sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <h3>Brown Sugar Syrup:</h3>
            <li>1 1/4 cups (250g) brown sugar</li>
            <li>6 1/2 tbsp (100ml) water</li>
            <li>1 tbsp (19g) molasses (added after boba is mixed in)</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <h3>Milk:</h3>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>2 tbsp black tea</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <h3>Brown Sugar Boba Pearls:</h3>
            <li>In a small saucepan, add in water and brown sugar and heat until boiling. </li>
            <li>Reduce heat to low and add in half the tapioca starch, quickly mixing in for 6-8 seconds, turn off the heat, and mix in the rest of the tapioca starch mixing until it forms a dough.</li>
            <li>Dump the dough out onto a work surface, and knead until a smooth dough forms. </li>
            <li>Divide the dough into four equal pieces, and roll each piece into a long rod (Â½-inch thick) then cut into small cubes.</li>
            <li>Roll the small cubes into balls and toss them into a bowl with tapioca starch to coat.</li>
            <li>Dump into a fine-mesh sieve to shake off the excess. Store in an airtight container in the freezer or use immediately.</li>
            <li>To cook, heat a medium pot of water over medium-high heat until boiling then add the pearls to the water. Boil for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cut the heat and let the pearls rest in the water for 20-25 minutes.</li>
            <li>For the syrup, add water and brown sugar to a small saucepot, swirl to combine, and heat over medium heat until it dissolves and starts to bubble. Increase heat to medium-high. Once large bubbles form and reduced, check the thickness by placing a dollop on a plate and checking with your fingers.</li>
            <li>Once syrupy, cut the heat.</li>
            <li>Drain boba pearls through a fine-mesh strainer. Stir into the syrup mixture along with molasses.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h3>Milk Tea:</h3>
            <li>To a small saucepan, add whole milk (or nut milk) and heat over medium heat stirring occasionally until it reaches 162F then immediately remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Mix in loose leaf black tea and let steep for 4-8 minutes, or until it reaches the desired strength of flavor.</li>
            <li>Strain the tea through a fine-mesh strainer. Cool in the refrigerator or over an ice bath before using.</li>
            <li>To a glass, spoon in as many boba pearls as desired then top with syrup.</li>
            <li>Add in the ice cubes before pouring in the chilled milk tea and serving.</li>
        </ol>
